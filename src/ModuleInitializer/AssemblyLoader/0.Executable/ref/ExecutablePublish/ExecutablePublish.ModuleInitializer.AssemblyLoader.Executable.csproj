<!--
ExecutablePublish.ModuleInitializer.AssemblyLoader.Executable.csproj

This project is a synthetic project. It creates the filesystem
publishment for the project specified by PackageSourceReference.

Firstly, the project specified by PackageSourceReference is published
to filesystem, then it gets special packed as executable. Finally the
package gets unzipped.

We want to use the .props and .targets inside the project like
it would be when you installed the nuget packge, otherwise we
would have to separate path logic for local use in projects.
